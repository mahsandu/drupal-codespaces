They had great products and loyal customers, but no structure in place to scale word-of-mouth into something measurable.</p><p><strong>What We Did</strong><br>We built a full affiliate strategy: from partner onboarding flows and payout structures to branded marketing kits and tracking dashboards. We also reached out to micro-influencers and curated a list of aligned partners.</p><p><strong>What Happened Next</strong><br>In just four months, affiliate-driven sales made up 22% of their total revenue. Partners loved the easy-to-use platform and professionally designed promo materials—and the brand gained a growing network of enthusiastic ambassadors.</p>'
